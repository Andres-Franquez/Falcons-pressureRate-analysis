# Falcons Defensive Pressure Imapct 2023-2024 SEASON
# 🏈 Atlanta Falcons Defensive Pressure Impact (2023–24)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes how defensive pressure, sacks and QB hits affect the opposing quarterback's performance and offensive efficiency for the **Atlanta Falcons** during the 2023–2024 NFL seasons.  

By quantifying metrics like **Expected Points Added (EPA)** and **Completion Percentage** under pressure vs. no pressure, this analysis demonstrates how increasing defensive disruption could lead to better outcomes for the Falcons defense.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure how often the Falcons defense generates pressure on passing plays.  
- Evaluate how pressure impacts opponent **EPA** and **completion rate**.  
- Visualize and interpret results to support potential defensive strategy improvements.

## 🧠 Key Insights
| Metric | No Pressure | Pressure | Interpretation |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Pressure Rate** | – | **14.24%** | Falcons generated pressure on ~14% of pass plays — below league average (~28–30%). |
| **Average EPA Allowed** | **+0.19** | **–0.81** | When the Falcons created pressure, opponent efficiency dropped dramatically. |
| **Completion % Allowed** | **68.5%** | **22.2%** | Pass accuracy collapsed when pressure occurred — a 46-point difference. |

> 🧩 *Takeaway:*  
> Even with a below-average pressure rate, Atlanta’s defensive success under pressure is elite.  
> Increasing QB disruption frequency could significantly reduce opponent scoring efficiency.
